    <h1 id="title">The Blind King</h1>
    <div class="author">By Manus Chaubey</div>
    <div id="story">
      <p>Once in a time before the world had a name, there was a Blind King who lived in a vast, empty void. The King was not cruel, nor kind, for there was only he. Though he could not perceive the surrounding void, he felt a strange restlessness in himself, a gnawing need to fill the silence.</p>
  
  
      <p>His hands, restless, began to paint. Without eyes to guide them, they smeared colors across the void's expanse. At first, his work was simple. He painted skies he had never seen, traced rivers he could only feel in dreams, and fields that whispered of wonders that he could not have conceived.</p>
  
  
      <p>Still the Blind King's hands did not rest. They moved without purpose or thought, driven by an instinct. Each flourish filled the canvas with intricate beauty. The still figures within his art began to evolve, transforming from mere shapes into creatures pregnant with unformed thought.</p> 
  
  
      <p>Unseen by the Blind King, his painted visions shimmered into reality within the canvas. The beings that arose there lived in an endless dawn, ignorant of suffering. They knew only the joy of existence, no history, no strife, just a sense that they had been brought forth by something grand and unknowable.</p> 
  
  
      <p>For a time, the painted world and its occupants thrived in its simplicity. But simplicity, like the first stroke of a brush, cannot endure. Just as a single seed, simple and unassuming, gives rise to a vast tree with countless branches, leaves, and fruits, so too does simplicity give birth to complexity.</p>

      <p>Colors mixed and spilled chaotically, the deep blue of rivers turned crimson as if infused with blood, while the vibrant gold of the skies bled into ashen grey, heavy with an unspoken gloom. The soft landscapes hardened into jagged peaks, and clarity gave way to shadow and doubt. New creatures were born, predators with sharp teeth and endless hunger. The once harmonious world descended into chaos as prey fled from predators, and the canvas thrummed with violence. Beauty yet remained, but a shadow in disguise.</p>
  
      <p>As the King's art evolved, so too did the minds of his creations. They began to build, to grow, to strive for more than survival. They formed kingdoms, waged wars, and sought meaning in their painted existence. And with each flourish of the King's hand, the canvas grew darker still.</p>
  
  
      <p>The paradise became a nightmare. He painted disease that ravaged the weak, storms that leveled cities, and despair that seeped into the hearts of even the strongest.</p>
  
  
      <p>At first, the painted beings accepted their suffering. They believed it was natural, as intrinsic to life as joy once was. But the Blind King, unaware of the suffering he caused, continued to paint. His hands, guided by no plan, created cycles of life and death, joy and sorrow. The beings within his art began to ask questions they could not answer: <i>Why are we here? Why must we suffer?</i></p>
  
  
      <p>And then, their world split like glass, a sudden, shattering clarity: <b>They were being painted.</b></p>
  
  
      <p>This knowledge was a curse. It brought no escape, only despair. The beings screamed to the sky, begging the painter to stop, to explain, to grant them a moment of peace. But the Blind King, with his unseeing eyes and tireless hand, did not hear. Or if he did, he could not stop.</p>
  
  
      <p>Some of the painted beings turned to faith, worshiping the Blind King as a God. Others turned to rebellion, seeking to defy their painted fates, though they could not leave the canvas. Yet no prayer, no rebellion, no action changed the hand that painted them.</p>
  
  
      <p>The Blind King, too, began to feel the weight of his art. Though he could not see what he painted, he felt the agony emanating from the silent canvas. It seeped into his bones, a whisper of overwhelming suffering and despair. Yet he could not stop. His hands moved as if guided, creating more beings, more horrors, more suffering. He began to question: <i>Why do I paint? Why can I not stop?</i> The endless expanse swallowed his questions whole, and in that crushing silence, he wondered...</p>
  
  
      <p>Just as his painted beings began to question their creator. Why was he so unheeding to their calls? Why was he so powerless to stop their suffering? And they wondered too...</p>
  
  
      <p><b>The painter himself was being painted.</b></p>
  
  
      <p>He, too, must be the product of another, his torment the work of another hand, and that hand guided by yet another.</p>
  
  
      <p>The painted beings continued to cry out, and the king continued to feel their anguish. Yet neither could break free. They realized there would be no salvation. No end. No escape.</p>
  
  
      <p>To be painted was to suffer. To paint was to inflict it, to share it, but also sublimate it. So in their torment, the painted beings too picked up the brush.</p> 
      
      <p>The canvas stretched endlessly before them, <b>waiting.</b></p>
